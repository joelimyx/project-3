Q: How often do you look for news either online or through an app?
A: Honestly I rarely go and look for news, it more or less comes to me when I use my Facebook or Twitter feed.

Q: Do you follow people who tend to post news articles to get that info or does it just kind of happen that people post news related things?
A: Mostly just happens naturally from random people in my feed sending links and stuff. 

Q: Of the articles that you find what grabs your attention and makes you want to read the article?
A: If the title/topic of the post seems like something I am interested in I will go and check it out, or if it is something with an interesting photo or something like that I usually will take a look.

Q: How often would you say you finish reading these articles?
A: If I had to put a number on it I would say I finish about 30-40% of the articles I open. I do skim through almost all of them but thats mainly to see if there is anything else interesting in the article.

Q: What do you mean by “anything else interesting”?
A: Like cool photos, maybe a video or something, or even something like a “related articles” section that might have a more interesting topic.

Q: Ok, so back to how often you finish articles, why do you only read 40% of them?
A: Well most of them tend to be “clickbait” and pretty uninteresting in the body of the article, or if after reading a little of it I can see the whole article could be just summed up as the title. Also some articles can be just plain old boring, even if the topic interests me.

Q: What about them makes them boring?
A: Usually its a combo of just bad writing and nothing else to keep my attention. As a very visual learner I like to have photos/diagrams/videos to help sustain my interest in the article.  Even if it is a well written article I would prefer some sort of media to go with it, I mean this is the internet not an old school news paper.

Q: How much time would you say you spend reading new articles?
A: Maybe 30-40 min a day 

Q: Do you typically do that in 1 sitting
A: No not really I usually end up finding 2-3 articles over a days time, 10-15 min here…10-15 min there

Q: Do you have any topics that you tend to gravitate towards?
A: I do typically take a look at anything about Brazil, I have a lot of family there and news from there is somewhat rare to me so I’ll try to read one if it comes up.

Q: So in an ideal “news” app for you, what would be in, features, content that sort of stuff?
A: I guess something where i can tell it what I would like to/not like to read(like turn off any politics articles), all the articles have some sort of media along with them, and maybe a notification when something about Brazil comes up…as long as the notifications aren’t too annoying.

Q: What about notifications would make them ”too annoying”?
A: Like I wouldn’t want a notification for everything new that gets posted and have my phone buzzing many times through the day about stuff I’m probably not interested in.  If it had a way give me notifications about a topic…like if it gave me a notification every time Brazil would be mentioned, that wouldn’t be going off every hr but maybe like once per day. Or maybe if it gave me 1 notification per day and had most of the topics from the past day like the Twitter highlights thing.

Q: How often do you look for news either online or through an app?
A: If I go and look for news I tend to use Flipboard on my phone

Q: Why do you choose Flipboard to search for news?
A: Honestly it came on my phone when I got a new phone and the guy at the store said he really enjoyed using it to find news that he wanted to look at/read so I gave it a shot and it wasn’t bad

Q: What about Flipboard do you like?
A: I like the way it is layed out..makes it easy to navigate through the app and it lets me slightly control what news comes into the app so I’m not drowning in stuff I don’t want to read.

Q: Of the articles that you find what grabs your attention and makes you want to read the article?
A: As much as I hate politics I try to read about things in that topic. Otherwise if the title seems appealing I’ll take a look at it.

Q: How often would you say you finish reading these articles?
A: Maybe half…most articles anyway are just filler writing and the title tells the whole story sometimes.

Q: So of the other half that you do read…what about them makes you finish reading them?
A: They are usually a good combo of writing and other media(photos/gif’s/videos)

Q: Can you define a “good combo” for me?
A: Well a good combo to me is a little harder to define than a bad/horrible one so I’ll talk about crappy combos if thats ok. If there are no pictures or maybe 1 I get very uninterested very quickly…and on the other end of the spectrum I have seen a bunch of articles more recently that are sooooo many pictures but not a lot of text like PICTURE..2 lines of text..PICTURE..2 lines of text and that just gets super annoying to me

Q: How much time would you say you spend reading new articles?
A: Maybe an hour

Q: Do you typically do that in 1 sitting
A: Yeah, I try to read a few articles in the morning with my coffee and breakfast…maybe pop on and see if anything interesting got posted at the end of the day

Q: So in an ideal “news” app for you, what would be in, features, content that sort of stuff?
A: I mean I like the flow of Flipbook its not too boring but not too complex/confusing. Maybe something where I can “mark” topics i don’t want to read about instead of just marking ones i do to clean up my feed a little bit. 
        
Q: Do you use the notifications from Flipbook?
A: No I turn them off.

Q: Why do you turn them off?
A: Well I turn almost all my notifications off except for my phone and text messages…if I want to see if there is something new on any app I’ll open it and use it…I done need it to tell me when I’m doing something at work or with the kids.
