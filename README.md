#### Overview

During Project 3, ADI students will work in groups to design and build an application that meets a set of technical and design specifications. Each set of specifications has been provided by the Android team at a real company--the idea is for students to work as part of a team on a real-world challenge. Each group of students will be assigned a project from the following list of project briefs:  

* [Vice](Vice)
* [TouchLab](TouchLab)
* [Yelp](Yelp)

These projects have been designed to be fairly open-ended and will allow for a great deal of creativity with regard to design, implementation and interaction. Students will have approximately two and a half weeks to work on this project. Please see the individual project briefs for more information on project requirements.
